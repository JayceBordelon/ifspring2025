                I am taking this class because of my major in HCI. Software
                development is easy. The unintuitive design process is what I
                struggle with and I hope to learn how to make better design
                patterns.

                I have had 4 software internships in full stack software
                engineering. I currently teach CSE330 - Rapid Prototype
                development. I spend a lot of freetime working on full stack
                projects! Here is
                <a href="https://jaycebordelon.netlify.app" target="_blank"
                    >my website</a
                >.
            </li>
            <li>I hope to learn a systematic way to approach design.</li>
            <li>
                Designing for screen requires a lot of concern for user
                experience and information retrieval.
            </li>
            <li>
                Good design:
                <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.
                I would consider this a good design because of the seamless font
                heierachy, color choices, and ease of navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Good communication:
                <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank"
                    >Trading View</a
                >. This is a good example of effective communication because of
                the product description and information availability within only
                the first page. You can even demo the product on the home page!
                The news sections are not cluttered and the site effectively
                takes advantage of white space.
            </li>
            <li>
                Works Well:
                <a
                    href="https://www.streamlinehq.com/?ref=Awwwards&utm_source=awwwards-honors&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=ultimate-icon-library&tab=all"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Streamline Icons</a
                >. Though the design pattern and system is simple, the site
                wastes no time with unnecessary information. It does it's job
                and serves Icons to the user without unnecessary clutter!
